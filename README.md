# Flight Fare Prediction in INDIA using Machine Learning model
### Pyton, ML

   Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism. As considering the travelling with flight we will be only go ahead with flight details such as the routes,journey time, etc. By adopting machine learning techniques to lessen the uncertainty of future flight pricing, technology can give a solution. We'll be using the Flight Price Dataset from Flight Price. This dataset contains items that cover domestic and international airline flights in India in 2019.

   The main aim of this notebook is to draw Machine learning model for better understanding of flight details,routes,fares and many more in the country(INDIA) from the given dataset. An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) technique is being implemented to study and analyze the flight fares.

   To meet the goal of our project.The main purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis is to help look at the data before making  any assumption,the following data helps us to understand the data clearly. In this notebook we will be Cleaning the data with appropriate techniques. handling the missing values and performing epxloratory data analysis on the given data to get better insights. and even plot the different features present in the column for better understanding and finally Modeling the data with various Machine Learning model with appropriate feature selection techniques.
